Research Design Lab's ARM Development Board Trainer Kit is designed keeping in mind the latest technology on a single board. This makes it really easy to design, experiment with, and test circuitry without soldering. Students can explore a wide variety of electronic concepts simply by placing components on to the breadboard. All connections and controls are clearly marked and conveniently located. It is very useful in electronics laboratories for performing experiments. It is also useful to build and test circuits as well as making projects related to electronic.
